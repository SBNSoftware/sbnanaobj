## Quick checklist

- [ ] Have you run `git fetch` and pulled the latest changes from the branch you're basing your PR against?
- [ ] If you're adding new classes, have you added them to classes_def.xml in the relevant directory?
- [ ] Have you added a checksum in classes_def.xml to **any and all** new classes you're implementing, *and rebuilt*?
- [ ] If you're updating classes, have you incremented the `ClassVersion` **by one** compared to develop in classes_def.xml?
