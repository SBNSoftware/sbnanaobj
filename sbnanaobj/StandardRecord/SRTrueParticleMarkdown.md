Markdown content of `caf::SRTrueParticle`
------------------------------------------

Standard units are listed in the [`README.md`](README.md) file.

Although all share the same class `caf::SRTrueParticle` (and `simb::MCParticle` as main source),
particles contain slightly different information when they are produced by an event generator (e.g. GENIE)
or by the detector simulation (e.g. LArG4).
